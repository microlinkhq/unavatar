## Quick start

The service is a single endpoint exposed in **unavatar.io** that can resolve:

- an **email**: https://unavatar.io/sindresorhus@gmail.com
- an **username**: https://unavatar.io/kikobeats
- a **domain**: https://unavatar.io/reddit.com

## Query parameters

### TTL

Type: `string`<br/>
Default: `'24h'`<br/>
Range: from `'1h'` to `'28d'`

It determines the maximum quantity of time an avatar is considered fresh.

e.g., https://unavatar.io/kikobeats?ttl=1h

When you look up for a user avatar for the very first time, the service will determine it and cache it respecting TTL value.

The same resource will continue to be used until reach TTL expiration. After that, the resource will be computed, and cache as fresh, starting the cycle.

### Fallback

Type: `string`|`boolean`

When it can't be possible to get a user avatar, a fallback image is returned instead, and it can be personalized to fit better with your website or application style.

You can get one from **boringavatars.com**:

e.g., https://unavatar.io/github/37t?fallback=https://source.boringavatars.com/marble/120/1337_user?colors=264653r,2a9d8f,e9c46a,f4a261,e76f51

or **avatar.vercel.sh**:

e.g., https://unavatar.io/github/37t?fallback=https://avatar.vercel.sh/37t?size=400

or even an static image:

e.g., https://unavatar.io/github/37t?fallback=https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66378906?v=4

You can pass `fallback=false` for explicitly disable this behavior. In that case, a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code will returned when is not possible to get the user avatar.

### JSON

This is in this way to make easier consume the service from HTML markup.

In case you want to get a JSON payload as response, just pass `json=true`:

e.g., https://unavatar.io/kikobeats?json

## Limitations

For preventing abusive usage, the service has associated a daily rate limit based on requests IP address.

You can verify for your rate limit state checking the following headers in the response:

- `x-rate-limit-limit`: The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute.
- `x-rate-limit-remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
- `x-rate-limit-reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.

When you reach the API quota limit, you will experience HTTP 429 errors, meaning you need to wait until the API quota reset.
